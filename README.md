![GIF showing example on how to embed links](readme-images/Auto-Embed%20Getting%20Started.gif)

Uses the [same syntax as Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages). Syntax: `![options](link)`


## Features
Auto embeds websites like: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). Full list of [supported websites](#supported-websites)

### Supported websites:
- [X](https://x.com) (Obsidian only supports twitter.com but not x.com)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) (Has some resizing bugs) <!-- TODO: Add description / link of why its not supported -->
- [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) (Has a 30 second preview limit. Spotify only allows full songs when logged in)

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin won't change Twitter and YouTube links since [Obsidian handles those](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages). Which means that [options](#custom-options) don't work. 

## Custom Options
How to add options: 
- In between the square brackets `[add options here]`, add your options. 
- If you aren't sure which options are available, refer to the table below

### All options:
| Option | Description | Example Markdown |
|---|---|---|
|noembed|Disables embedding on this iframe|`![noembed](https://example.com)`
|w:`value` / width:`value`|Sets embed's width Uses [CSS Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths)|`![w:100%](https://example.com)`

<!---

TODO: Find out how to format size. the seperator between width and height is "x". Conflicts with "px"

## How the plugin works
A brief overview of how the plugin works. Not required to use the plugin, just for those who are curious. To understand it, requires basic knowledge of HTML and Obsidian.
1. Has 2 different methods depending on the viewing mode:
	- In <u>Reading View</u>: <br>
		Searches for the `<img>` tag that's generated by Obsidian when you use the this format: `![](link)`
	- In <u>Live Preview</u>: <br>
		Searches for `![](link)` and gets the [options](#custom-options) and url from it.
2. Gets the url from it, convert it to the embed equivalent. Usually it's the same website but only with the content. No headers, sidebar, etc
	- Example: <br>https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/LYNZwGm converts to https://codepen.io/jh3y/embed/LYNZwGm?default-tab=result&editable=true
3. Replaces those tags with `<iframe>` and apply options.
4. Some websites like Twitter, Reddit or Imgur, will send a resize message. The plugin uses the info to resize the embed.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for other websites (Suggest some examples?)
	- [ ] Google Maps
	- [ ] Google Docs
	- [ ] Google Calendar
	- [ ] Notion 
	- [ ] Other websites. [Iframely](https://iframely.com/domains) has a list of websites that are embeddable.
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Updated README.md
	- [ ]  Add images / gifs to show examples
 	- [ ]  Add installation instructions
- [ ]  Submit to Obsidian plugin directory?

### Current Limitations & Known Bugs 
- **Reddit**: Incorrect resizing of Reddit embeds when there are multiple Reddit embeds that appear in the same page.
- **Spotify**: Only able to play 30 seconds of a song. Spotify only allows when the user is logged in the browser, which is not possible in Obsidian. 
- **Live Preview**: It's still experimental which means it might have bugs. Please [send any issues](https://github.com/GnoxNahte/obsidian-auto-embed/issues) you found!
- **Mobile**: Not tested yet

## Frequently asked questions
### The embed isn't appearing
1. Have you enabled the plugin?
2. Are you following this syntax? `![](link)`<br>
	For example: `![]()`
