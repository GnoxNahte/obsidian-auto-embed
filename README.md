## Getting Started

4. Done! Wait for the embed to load

![GIF showing example on how to embed links](readme-images/Auto-Embed%20Getting%20Started.gif)

Uses the [same syntax as Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages). Syntax: `![options](link)`


## Features
Auto embeds websites like: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). Full list of [supported websites](#supported-websites)

### Supported websites:
- [X](https://x.com) (Obsidian only supports twitter.com but not x.com)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) (Has some resizing bugs) <!-- TODO: Add description / link of why its not supported -->
- [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) (Has a 30 second preview limit. Spotify only allows full songs when logged in)

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin won't change Twitter and YouTube links since [Obsidian handles those](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages). Which means that [options](#custom-options) don't work. 

## Custom Options
How to add options: 
- In between the square brackets `[add options here]`, add your options. 
- If you aren't sure which options are available, refer to the table below

### All options:
| Option | Description | Example Markdown |
|---|---|---|
|noembed|Disables embedding on this iframe|`![noembed](https://example.com)`
|w:`value` / width:`value`|Sets embed's width Uses [CSS Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths)|`![w:100%](https://example.com)`

<!--- 
TODO: Dark mode

TODO: Find out how to format size. the seperator between width and height is "x". Conflicts with "px"
|size: `value`x`value`|Sets both embed's width and height. Uses [CSS Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths)|`[size:100%x300px](example.com)`

## How the plugin works
A brief overview of how the plugin works. Requires basic knowedge of HTML and Obsidian.
1. <details>
		<summary> In <a href="https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/obsidian-playbook/Using+Obsidian/02+Making+Notes+in+Obsidian/Views+in+Obsidian#Reading+view">Reading View</a></summary>
		Searches for `<img>` tags that's generated by Obsidian when you use the `![](link)` format
	</details>

		<summary> In <a href="https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/obsidian-playbook/Using+Obsidian/02+Making+Notes+in+Obsidian/Views+in+Obsidian#Live+Preview">Live Preview</a></summary>
		Searches for the `!` character that appears in `![](link)` and gets the [options](#custom-options) and the url from the next characters.
	</details>



	In [Live Preview](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/obsidian-playbook/Using+Obsidian/02+Making+Notes+in+Obsidian/Views+in+Obsidian#Live+Preview): <br>
	Searches for the `!` character that appears in `![](link)` and gets the [options](#custom-options) and the url from the next characters.
2. Gets the url from it, convert it to the embed equivalent. Usually the same website just focusing on the content. Don't have the header, footer, etc
	<details>
		<summary>Example: </summary>
		"https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/LYNZwGm" -> "https://codepen.io/jh3y/embed/LYNZwGm?default-tab=result&editable=true"
	</details>
3. Replaces those tags with `<iframe>` and apply options.
4. Some websites like twitter, reddit or imgur, they'll send a resize message. So resize the embed using that info

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for other websites (Suggest some examples?)
	- [ ] Google Maps
	- [ ] Google Docs
	- [ ] Google Calendar
	- [ ] Notion 
	- [ ] Other websites. [Iframely](https://iframely.com/domains) has a list of websites that are embeddable.
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Updated README.md
	- [ ]  Add images / gifs to show examples
 	- [ ]  Add installation instructions
- [ ]  Submit to Obsidian plugin directory?

### Current Limitations & Known Bugs 
- **Reddit**: Incorrect resizing of Reddit embeds when there are multiple Reddit embeds that appear in the same page.
- **Spotify**: Only able to play 30 seconds of a song. Spotify only allows when the user is logged in the browser, which is not possible in Obsidian. 
- **Live Preview**: It's still experimental which means it might have bugs. Please [send any issues](https://github.com/GnoxNahte/obsidian-auto-embed/issues)!
- **Mobile**: Not tested yet

## Frequently asked questions
### The embed isn't appearing
1. Have you enabled the plugin?
2. Are you following this syntax? `![](link)`<br>
	For example: `![]()`
