## How the plugin works
A brief overview with some steps on how the plugin works. *Not required to use the plugin*, just for those who are curious. Certain steps vary depending on whether you're in **Reading View** or **Live Preview**. However, the plugin doesn't have any impact when you're in source mode.
1. Search where in the document the syntax is found.
	- In **Reading View**: <br>
		Searches for the `<img>` tag that's generated by Obsidian when you use this format: `![](link)`
	- In **Live Preview**: <br>
		Searches for `![](link)` and gets the [options](#custom-options) and URL from it.
2. Get the URL from it, and convert it to the embed equivalent. Usually adds `/embed/` somewhere in the url. Results in the same website but focused only on the content. No headers, footer, etc
	- Example: <br>https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/LYNZwGm converts to https://codepen.io/jh3y/embed/LYNZwGm?default-tab=result&editable=true
3. Replace those tags with `<iframe>` and apply options (width, height, dark mode, etc)
4. Some websites like Twitter, Reddit or Imgur, will send a resize message. The plugin uses the info to resize the embed.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for other websites (If you want other websites, create an issue or message me)
	- [ ] Google Maps
	- [ ] Google Docs
	- [ ] Google Calendar
	- [ ] Notion 
	- [ ] Other websites. [Iframely](https://iframely.com/domains) has a list of websites that can be embedded.
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Updated README.md
	- [ ] Improve readability. Open to suggestions, especially if something isn't clear!
	- [ ]  Add images/gifs to show examples
 	- [ ]  Add installation instructions
- [ ]  Submit to Obsidian plugin directory?

### Current Limitations & Known Bugs 
- General
	- **Live Preview**: It's still experimental which means it might have bugs. 
	- **Mobile**: Not tested yet
- Website specific
	- **Reddit**: Incorrect resizing of Reddit embeds when multiple Reddit embeds appear in the same view.  <br><u>Temporary fix methods:</u>
		- Space out Reddit embeds such that there aren't multiple embeds in your view
		- Manually set the height by using options: `![h:240px](Reddit link)`
	- **Spotify**: Only able to play 30 seconds of a song. Spotify only allows when the user is logged in to the browser, which is not possible in Obsidian. 
	- **Twitter & YouTube**: Since [Obsidian supports it](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages), I won't interfere with it. However, it means that [options](#custom-options) isn't supported. I might be able to replace Obsidian's embeds with mine, but it'll only work in *Live Preview*, but not *Reading Mode*. This makes an inconsistent user experience but if you want this feature, contact me.
	- **Twitter / X**: Obsidian supports https://twitter.com but not https://x.com. This plugin just helps to embed X. If you replace Twitter with x, or vice versa, it'll lead to the same tweet/post. Usually when copying from the mobile app, it's X. When copying from the web, it's Twitter.
